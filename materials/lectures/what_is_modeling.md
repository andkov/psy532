What is modelling
---
  
  The word "model" is used in science quite a lot, especially in the last few decades. Everything scientists do nowadays seems to be "modelling' of some sort. In essence, modeling is a story about three things: data, model, and error. 
  
  When we "do science", we describe how these three came to be in our case and what their properties and interrelatedness can tell us about how the world works. 
  
  Each research project is a story about data, model, and error. I well-told story involving these thre3 entities shape our understanding of the phenomena
