## Quick start

Start learning R interactively with [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html), an R package that creates a dialogue environment inside RStudio.  

To initiate a learning session, open your RStudio and execute the following code:  

```
install.packages("swirl")  
install.packages("Rtools")  
install.packages("devtools")  
devtools::install_github(c("swirldev/swirl", "swirldev/swirlify"))  
library(swirl)  
```

Follow the prompt and complete the first lesson.

Watch an [intro into swirl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1tBTlrx0JY) by its creator [Nick Carchedi](http://nickcarchedi.com/). DataCamp's [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) might also be helpful to hit the road running.
