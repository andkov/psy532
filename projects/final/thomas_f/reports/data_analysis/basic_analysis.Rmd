##Load Packages
Prepare RStudio environment for all tasks to follow. 
```{r LoadPackages, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

```{r load_sources, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

```{r DeclareGlobals, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

We load the data derived by the script "./reports/data_preparation/dsL_hrs.R"" 
Variables chosen are age in years, eduction in years, gender, race, if they drink currently, if they smoked ever,
```{r LoadData, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Load graph settings for creating figures
```{r LoadGraphSettings, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Chooses variables for model - End up with model of ~6 or 7 due to conflicting results (seemed reasonable - dropped the least significant factors which were gender, mstot, depressive symptoms and sample weight
```{r model_selection, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```
Create Plots of cognition, number of chronic conditions, education in years and age in years by BMI (with gender, if they drank, and race included as factors)
```{r add_graphs, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Creates prediction function for models
```{r get_prediction_function, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Creates models of variables of interest
```{r define_models, echo=TRUE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Adds models to figures produced above
```{r add_model_data, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

## Conclusions

### Health conditions

Data show that the more health conditions you have, the higher your BMI. Given the high co-incidence of obesity (see Patterson et al., 2004) with certain health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, this is not a surprising finding.

### Age

Data show that the older you are, the lower your BMI is. This is not a suprising finding, given that people who live longer tend to have better health, which would ideally correlate with a lower BMI.

###Cogtot

Data show that the higher your cognition, the lower your BMI.

###Education

Data seem show that the more years of education you have, the higher your BMI. This is somewhat suprising given that conventional wisdom (my bias?) says that education tends to correlate with wealth which correlates with better health. This could either indicate a problem with my conflation of BMI as a measurement of overall health or with differences in the retired population.

###Race

Race seems to show that being african american correlates with a higher BMI, this is not a super suprising finding, somewhat expected.

###Drink

Drinking data seems to show that when participants drink, they are more likely to have a lower BMI. This is a very suprising finding, although it could indicate a problem with their definition of drinking. Unfortunately I was unable to find the operation definition of if a participant drank or not, which could mean either quite a bit of drinking or just a certain number of drinks per week. 


###Shlt

Participants rating of their health (self-rated health score) indicates that people who rate their health lower tend to have a higher BMI.


## Appendix

Removes all variables except variables conisdered for models
```{r CleanUp, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
