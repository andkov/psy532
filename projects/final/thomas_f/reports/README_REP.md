### Summary of Final project
 
#### This file has links to the various reports - both for the data preperation and analysis 
 
links to data preperation code: [data prep R](./data_preperation/dsl_hrs_annotated.R)

links to data preperation (Rmd): [data prep Rmd](./data_preperation/dsl_hrs_annotated.Rmd)

link to data preperation report (html): [data prep html](./data_preperation/dsl_hrs_annotated.html)

links to data analysis code: [data analysis R](./data_analysis/basic_analysis.R)

links to data analysis (Rmd): [data analysis Rmd](./data_analysis/basic_analysis.Rmd)

link to data analysis report (html): [data analysis html](./data_analysis/basic_analysis.html)

Note: Two basic analysis files were made, one could be considered normal, while the other is a segmented file. The segmented file simply means that much of the code was subdivided in further knitr chunks to better prepare the analysis to be transformed into slides. The links to these files are below:
