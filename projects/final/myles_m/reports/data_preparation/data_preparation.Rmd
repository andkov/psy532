This dataset provides key health indicators for 
local communities and encourages dialogue about actions that can be taken to improve community health 
(e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer). The CHSI and dataset, published in 2000, was designed not only for public health 
professionals but also for members of the community who are interested in the health of their community. 
The CHSI report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although CHSI presents 
indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer, it is imperative to understand that behavioral factors 
such as obesity, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially 
contribute to these deaths.

The CHSI data set can be examined and downloaded [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-to-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer), and specific county data investigated [here](http://wwwn.cdc.gov/communityhealth).

First, we'll load the necessary packages.
```{r LoadPackages, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Next, we'll load the data into R, and create both a full dataset and a dataset with just the variables of interest.
```{r LoadData, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Next, we will examine the data to see what we have to work with.
```{r QueryData1, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

There are null values represented as large negative numbers in this dataset (e.g., -1111, -2222), so let's remove those.
```{r RemoveIllegal, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

High school diplomas, unemployment, and major depression are counts, so let's make new variables as percentages of the population.
```{r MutateData01, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Now lets see how the data looks after we've removed the null values and duplicated the count variables as percentages.
```{r QueryData2, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Let's save the full data set and the modified data set to be used for analysis later.
```{r SaveDerivedData, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

Lastly, lets clean up our mess.
```{r CleanUp, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```
