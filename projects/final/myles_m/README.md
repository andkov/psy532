To retrieve, consolidate, and clean the data, please open [data preparation script](./scripts/data/data_prep_script.R) .

The raw data is located in *./data/raw/* and has multiple .csv files.  
The derived data is saved in *./data/derived/*. This folder contains both the full dataset *full.rds* and the modified dataset *dsm.rds* .

To run the data analysis, please open [data analysis script](./scripts/data/data_analysis_script.R) .

For the report on data preparation, please open [data preparation report](./reports/data_preparation/data_preparation.html) .

I've also spent some time exploring shiny and ggvis.

For my shiny script, click [here](./scripts/data/shiny_script.R) .

And here's an R markdown file with some interactive fun things [right here](./reports/shiny/shiny.Rmd) .

Unfortunately I was unable to save this shiny.Rmd as an html, so you'll need to open it and run it in order to see what I've done.

Enjoy!
