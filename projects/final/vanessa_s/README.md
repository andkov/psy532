#Final Project: Depressive Symptoms in Late Adulthood 
##Vanessa Scarapicchia

The current analysis will focus on a data set collected for the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The analysis project (final532) and its components are stored in in the following sub-directories:

* A data folder containing [raw](./data/raw) and [derived](./data/derived) data sets 
* A reports folder containing scripts, R Markdown, and HTML files for my [data preparation](./reports/data_preparation), [data analysis](./reports/data_analysis), and [presentation slides](./reports/presentation_slides) 
* A scripts folder containing scripts related to [graphs](./scripts/graphs) and [data](./scripts/data)
* A libs folder containing supporting files, such as [css files](./libs/css)

**To reproduce my project**, first begin by opening and running my [data preparation report](./reports/data_preparation/data_preparation.R) script. The link to the prepared HTML file for this script can be found [here.](./reports/data_preparation/data_preparation.html)

You may then open and run my [data analysis report](./reports/data_analysis/data_analysis.R) script. The link to the prepared HTML file for this script can be found [here.](./reports/data_analysis/data_analysis.html)

Finally, in order to view my presentation of the entire analysis, you can follow [this direct link](./reports/presentation_slides/presentation_slides.html) to my slides.


*Thank you and enjoy!*
