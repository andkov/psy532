##Data

![](http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/images/logo2zz2.gif)


The Health and Retirement Study is a longitudinal study of health, retirement and aging sponsored by the National Institute on Aging

- Conducted through University of Michigan

- Launched in 1992

- Longitudinal study

- Testing adults over 50 once every 2 years

##Load Data

- Removed missing data

- Chose one timepoint within dataset (wave=4)

```{r LoadData, echo=C_echo, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Variables of interest

- BMI
- Gender
- Age
- Years of education
- Vigorous activity
- Cognition
- Psychiatric issues

#Data Exploration

##Histogram BMI
```{r histogram1, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Histogram Age
```{r histogram2, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Histogram Cognition
```{r histogram3, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Histogram Years of Education
```{r histogram4, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Scatterplot
```{r Scatterplot1, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```
The general trend of this scatterplot suggests that BMI increases as cognition increases

##Scatterplot
```{r Scatterplot2, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```
The general trend of this scatterplot suggests that as individuals get older, BMI decreases

##Scatterplot
```{r Scatterplot3, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```
The general trend of this scatterplot suggests that as years of education increases, BMI decreases

#Creating a Model to Predict BMI

##Subset Selection

- Regsubsets function performs best subset selection (using RSS)

- Best subset selection fits a separate least squares regression for each possible combination of the p predictors

##Best Subset Selection
```{r Bestsubsetselection, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Best Subset Selection Forward Stepwise

- Forward stepwise begins with a model containing no predictors, and then adds predictors to the model one-at-a-time, until all predictors are in the model.

##Forward
```{r SubsetSelectionForward, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Best Subset Selection Backward Stepwise

- Backward stepwise begins with the full least squares model containing all p predictors, and then removes the least useful predictor one-at-a-time.

##Backward
```{r SubsetSelectionBackward, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Adjusted r-squared, Cp, and BIC

- Adjusted r-squared says that a model with 5 factors is optimal

```{r adjustedrsquared, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

- Cp says that a model with 4 factors is optimal

```{r cp, echo=FALSE, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

- BIC says that a model with 4 factors is optimal

```{r bic, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Plot

- Plot Adjusted r-squared with a point on the which.max() value calculated above

```{r plottingadjr2, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Plot

- Plot Cp with a point on the which.min() value calculated above

```{r plottingcp, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Plot

- Plot BIC with a point on the which.min() value calculated above

```{r plottingbic, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Linear Models

- Linear model with all 6 factors
- The linear model with all 6 factors shows that all variables are significant predictors of BMI except for psychiatric issues and cognition.

```{r Analysis1, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Model with 5 factors

- Relationship of BMI with vigorous activity, age, gender, years of education, and psychiatric issues

- These variables chosen by looking at best subset selection

- This is the optimal model size suggested by adjusted r-squared which.max() function

##Model with 5 factors

- The linear model with 5 variables shows that all variables are significant predictors of BMI except for psychiatric issues

```{r Analysis2, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Model with 4 factors

- Relationship of BMI with vigorous activity, age, gender, and years of education

- Variables were chosen by looking at best subset selection

- This is the optimal model size suggested by Cp and BIC which.min() function

##Model with 4 factors

- The linear model with 4 variables shows that all variables are significant predictors of BMI

```{r Analysis3, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```


##Linear model with cognition

- Wanted to explore whether cognition would be a significant predictor on its own in a model since it was not significant in the model with 6 factors

```{r Analysis7, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

- WOW! How deceiving.

##Linear model with psychiatric issues

```{r Analysis8, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

- WOW! How deceiving.

##Linear model with cognition and psychiatric issues

```{r Analysis9, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

- WOW! How deceiving.


##Final linear model

- The final model I chose to predict BMI is the model with 4 factors (age, years of education, gender, and vigorous activity). 

- Both BIC and Cp had the lowest values with this model size, and best subset selection (all 3 methods) suggested that these 4 factors should be the factors included in this size model.

- All factors within this model are statistically significant predictors of BMI, whereas in the 5 factor model psychiatric issues wasn't significant

##Final linear model

```{r Finalanalysis, echo=F, message=C_message, warning=C_warning}
```

##Coefficients
The coefficients tell us the as BMI increases by 1 point:

- vigorous activity decreases by (.82, SD=.103)

- age decreases by (.15, SD=.007)

- the effect of being male increases by (.63, SD=.101)

- and years of education decreases by (.14, SD=.015).

#Conclusion

##To summarize

- From the 6 initial predictors in my dataset, I found that the model with age, years of education, vigorous activity and gender best predicts BMI

- The coefficients tell us that as BMI increases:
- age decreases
- years of education decreases
- effect of being male increases

- Also discovered how misleading linear models can be when I looked into cognition and psychiatric issues on their own
