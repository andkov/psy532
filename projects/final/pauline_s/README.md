Pauline's Final Project
---

Hi there! Welcome to Pauline's Final Project for PSYC 532. The project has been organized into folders depending on what you would like to see. "data" contains the data set used for the analyses. "reports" contains the preparation, analysis and the powerpoint presentation of the results. "scripts" contains the supplementary scripts necessary to run certain functions.

The data set comes from the Health and Retirement Study (Patricia St.Clair, Delia Bugliari, Nancy Campbell, Sandy Chien, Orla Hayden, Michael Hurd, Regan Main, Angela Miu, Mike Moldoff, Constantijn Panis, Philip Pantoja, Afshin Rastegar, Susann Rohwedder, Marian Oshiro, Julie Zissimopoulos, 2011) through the RAND Center for the Study of Aging, and funded by the Social Security Administration and the National Institute on Aging.
