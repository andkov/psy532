What will be covered
===============
Joe asked to answer the following:  
- What were your project **GOALS**?    
-	What did you **DO**?   
-	What did you **LEARN**?  

I would also like to tell you about:
- What we did NOT do
- Why not
- Why we should get more money to do it



What were your project **GOALS**? 
========================================================
- 1. to flip introductory graduaduate statistics course that introduces R programming  
- 2. to produce a set of interactive lessons using [swirl](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/materials/swirl/quickstart.md)

What did you **DO**?  
========================================================
- [X] flip introductory graduaduate statistics course
</br>
Specifically, 
* course [portal/calendar](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/README.md) and [log](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/log.md)
* video lectures, radio podcasts, slides, scripts, templates, [timeline](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/materials/people/timeline.md)  
* sourced [bibliography](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/library.md) and [reading plan](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/materials/scope.md) 
*  review of [online resources](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/resources.md) on statistics with R  
* live examples of analytic [reporting](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/tree/master/projects)
* publishing self-containt [github repository](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/README.md) for course portal


What did we NOT **DO**? 
=======================================
- [-] we did not produce a set of interactive lessons using [swirl](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/materials/swirl/quickstart.md).  We hoped to  to extend the existing [collection of swirl courses](../materials/swirl/course_notes.md), but flipping the course consumed of our resources. 

so before telling you we should get the money to do it after all, let me tell you

What did you **LEARN**?
