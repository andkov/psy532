    "contents" : "[edit me](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/edit/master/resources.md)  \n\n\n\n\n## R & Data science\n- [Swirl courses](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) and my [annotations](./materials/swirl/course_notes.md) to them. [quick start with swirl](./materials/swirl/quickstart.md) if you want to learn inside the environment where you'll end up spending all the time anyway. Think of this as a prompt-only computer game from the 80s: programming calculators never been so much fun!     \n- [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r)  by DataCamp. Slick, responsive interface. Great place to start for complete newbies to programming in general.      \n- [Introduction to R](http://ateucher.github.io/rcourse_site/)  by [Andy Teucher](https://github.com/ateucher), a\n- [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)  by [Software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) \n\n\n- [Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization) and particularly their [Curated Knowledge](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/curated/) (*DSS*) page. One of the best resources on data science has been coming from John Hopkins University, as this lecture series on Coursera.  \n- [Introduction to data analysis](http://stat405.had.co.nz/) course Hadley Wickham taught at Rice University in 2012  \n- [Data School](http://www.dataschool.io/about/) blog and learning space by [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham), former *DSS* TA and developer. \n\n\n\n\n##Statistics\n- [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-and-statistical-inference_mine-cetinkaya-rundel-by-datacamp) by DataCamp  \n\n- [Statistical computing for biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/courses/statcomputing/)  by Honkgkai Ji, at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  \n\n- Collection of [R Tutorials](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) by Kelly Black at Clarkson Univeristy. Approximately covers an intro to stats undergrad course.\n\n- [Introduction to Biostatistics](http://stronginference.com/Bios6301/)  taught at Vanderbilt by [Chris Fonnesbeck](https://github.com/fonnesbeck?tab=repositories)\n\n- [Statistical Computing in R](http://www.pitt.edu/~njc23/) a biostatistics course by   Nicholas Christian at University of Pittsburgh.  Great series of slides on essential programming vocabulary and techniques  for statistical modeling. Exemplifies SWEAVE for report generation.  \n\n- [Introductory modeling course](http://statpower.net/310LectureSlides.html) introductory course in Statistical Inference for graduate students in Psychological Sciences by James Steiger  at Vanderbilt University   \n\n- [Information Visualization](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/courses/120/lectures.html) course by Ross Ihaka, one of the creators of R language. Also see his courses on [Statistical Computing](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~stats380/?Lecture_Slides) and  [Statistical Graphics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/courses/787/)\n\n##Go-to places \n- [A GOOD PLACE TO START LEARNING R](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/): RStudio team collects the best online resources. Check out every link they mention, it's worth it.  \n- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - thorough and convenient resource for R reference. One of the first results to show up in search engines. \n- [RStudio cheatsheets](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are so well done that I have put them all into a single [pdf](./materials/pdf/R_Studio_Cheat_Sheets.pdf) and keep it on my Desktop.\n- [R by Example](http://www.mayin.org/ajayshah/KB/R/) organized example scripts. \n- [Most useful R commands](http://www.personality-project.org/r/r.commands.html) according to [personality-project.org](http://www.personality-project.org/index.html) ([William Revelle](http://www.personality-project.org/revelle.html))\n- [areaF](https://github.com/andkov/areaF/blob/master/concept.md) is a visual display of ANOVA table, comparing and contrasting the properties of restricted (basic, null) and full(saturated, alternative) models.\n\n\n## Videos\n\n###Collections\n- [twotorials](http://www.twotorials.com/) A collection of video tutorials on R\n- [Hastie and Tibshirani](http://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/) narrate their book.  \n\n###Particulars\n- [lady tasting tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgs7d5saFFc) short video on designing experiment in words of R.A. Fisher.    \n- [dude tapping bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVMVGHkt2cg) or p-value extravaganza. \n\n\n##Data \n\n- Excellent [collection of datasets](http://www.statsci.org/datasets.html) \n- [HistData](./data/HistData/Encyclopedia_HistData.md) Wiki overviews some of the historic datasets from the [HistData](./data/HistData/README.md) package that will be used in the course.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n# Views and conventions \n\n- I do my best to follow the [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)\n\n# More \n\n[edit me](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/edit/master/resources.md)  \n \n \n \n \n \n",
