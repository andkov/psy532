[Statistical Modeling](./skills.md#Statistical-Modeling)  \n4. [Dynamic Reporting](./skills.md#Dynamic-Reporting)  \n\nYou can review my discussion of toolbox and skillset of reproducible research in slides and videoes [here](http://ialsa.github.io/COAG-colloquium-2014F/)\n\n\n#Skill sets\n  Links grouped by the skillset. \n\n\n\n##Data Management\n\n-  [Introduction to data cleaning in R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf), a discussion paper by Edwin de Jonge and \nMark van der Loo.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n##Graph Production\n- Winston Chang's [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) is a perfect book to get you started with producing graphs with RStudio.  \n- [ggplots for publication](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/11/20/formatting-plots-for-pubs.html).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Statistical Modeling \n   - Doug Bates on statistical modeling with Julia([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9Io-p_iymI)   \n\n### Package support  \n\n#### Package dplyr::\n- [Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) the official vignette of the package.  \n- [Tutorials for the dplyr package in R](https://github.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial) by [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham)\n- A work-along scripts following Wickham's [Tidy data](https://github.com/justmarkham/tidy-data) paper, but re-doing it in dplyr. \n\n\n#### Package stats::\n\n##### Function stats::lm()\n\n##### Function stats::glm() \n\n - Comparing functions [stats::lm() vs stats::glm()](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/comments/2izyw1/difference_between_glm_and_lm_lmyxz_and_glmyxz/)  \n \n#### Package lme4::  \n - lme4::lmer()  \n\n#### Package nlme::\n\n##### Function nlme::gls()  \n -    \n \n##### Function nlme::lme()\n\n - Comparing functions [nlme::gls() vs. nlme::lme()](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395102/gls-vs-lme-in-the-nlme-package)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Dynamic Reporting\n\n###Git and GitHub\n- [GitHub cheat sheet](https://github.com/justmarkham/github-cheat-sheet) by Kevin Markham. All issues have screen-shots. More resources in the README after the link.\n- [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) by Kevin Markham\n\n\n\n### Markdown\n- in-browser [markdown simulator](https://demo.ocpu.io/markdownapp/www/), created in javascript by  [Jeroen Ooms](http://jeroenooms.github.io/). Great for playing with markdown formatting and doing simple tasks and demonstrations in R without installation.\n\n- [markdown in R](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.ca/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html) : a blog entry on getting started with **rmarkdown** - a version of markdown enhanced for the use with RStudio.  By Jeromy Anglim.\n- [markdown guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) : a well-written \"breaking into\" guide. Gives ample verbal description. Recommended for newbies. By John Gruber.  \n- [markdown cheat-sheet](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) : brief, simple, parallel view of what the code is doing. By Mashery group.   \n\n- another [markdown simulator](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html) with a different feel. You can't run R script in here, but it's good for understanding the formatting. Give a link to a decent cheatsheet on markdown. \n- [MultiMarkdown](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User's%20Guide.md) allows for mathematical formulas and other features   \n\n\n\n### Rmarkdown\n- see the official [documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) by RStudio, best starting point IMHO\n\n### Slides  \n- RStudio provides a native format for creating presentations - **.Rpres**, availible in the \"New file\" option. For a quick start with .Rpres see this [article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations)\n",
