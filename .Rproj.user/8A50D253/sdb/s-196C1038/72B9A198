    "contents" : "# Quick start with R\n\n- [A GOOD PLACE TO START LEARNING R](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/): RStudio team collects the best online resources. Check out every link they mention, it's worth it.  \n\n- [Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization) well-composed series of courses on data science.  \n\n\nStart learning R interactively with [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html), an R package that creates a dialogue environment inside RStudio.  \n\nTo initiate a learning session, open your RStudio and execute the following code:  \n\n```\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")  \ninstall.packages(\"Rtools\")  \ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")  \ndevtools::install_github(c(\"swirldev/swirl\", \"swirldev/swirlify\"))  \nlibrary(swirl)  \n```\n\nFollow the prompt and complete the first lesson.\n\nA great [intro into swirl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1tBTlrx0JY) by its creator [Nick Carchedi](http://nickcarchedi.com/)\n\nI also recommend completing two free interactive courses at DataCamp: [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) and [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-and-statistical-inference_mine-cetinkaya-rundel-by-datacamp). Their content partially overlaps with the training by two available courses by [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) package, but gives a different take and examples. \n\n\n\n# Courses\n\n## R\n- [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r)  by DataCamp   \n- [Introduction to R](http://ateucher.github.io/rcourse_site/)  by [Andy Teucher](https://github.com/ateucher)\n- [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)  by [Software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)\n\n## Statistics\n- [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-and-statistical-inference_mine-cetinkaya-rundel-by-datacamp) by DataCamp  \n- [statistical computing for biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/courses/statcomputing/)  by Honkgkai Ji , Ph.D., at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  \n- Collection of [R Tutorials](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) by Kelly Black at Clarkson Univeristy.
