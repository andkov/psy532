Slick, responsive interface. Great place to start for complete newbies to programming in general.      \n- [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)  by [Software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) \n\n\n##Data Science\n- [Introduction to data analysis](http://stat405.had.co.nz/) course Hadley Wickham taught at Rice University in 2012    \n- [Information Visualization](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/courses/120/lectures.html) course by Ross Ihaka, one of the creators of R language. Also see his courses on [Statistical Computing](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~stats380/?Lecture_Slides) and  [Statistical Graphics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/courses/787/)\n- [Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization) and particularly their [Curated Knowledge](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/curated/) page. One of the best resources on data science has been coming from John Hopkins University, as did this lecture series on Coursera.   \n- [Swirl courses](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) and my [annotations](./materials/swirl/course_notes.md) to them. [quick start with swirl](./materials/swirl/quickstart.md). Most of the courses overlap with (*DSS*), giving the same material in the interactive environment of RStudio. It also have unique courses, which number is expected to increase in the future.    \n\n\n##Statistics\n- [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-and-statistical-inference_mine-cetinkaya-rundel-by-datacamp) by DataCamp.    \n- [Introduction to R](http://ateucher.github.io/rcourse_site/)  by [Andy Teucher](https://github.com/ateucher). Great example of github use. Local option.  \n- [Introduction to Biostatistics](http://stronginference.com/Bios6301/)  taught by [Chris Fonnesbeck](https://github.com/fonnesbeck?tab=repositories) at Vanderbilt University.    \n- Collection of [R Tutorials](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) by Kelly Black at Clarkson Univeristy. Approximately covers an intro to stats undergrad course.  \n- [Statistical Computing for Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/courses/statcomputing/)  by Honkgkai Ji, at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.    \n- [Statistical Computing in R](http://www.pitt.edu/~njc23/) a biostatistics course by   Nicholas Christian at University of Pittsburgh.  Great series of slides on essential programming vocabulary and techniques  for statistical modeling. Exemplifies SWEAVE for report generation.  \n- [Statistical Inference](http://statpower.net/310LectureSlides.html), introductory course in statistics for graduate students at Vanderbilt University, taught by James Steiger.      \n\n\n##Blogs \n\n- [Data School](http://www.dataschool.io/about/) blog and learning space by [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham), former *DSS* TA and developer.    \n- [rbloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) central hub for blogging about data science with R.    \n\n\n##Handy PDFs\n- [RStudio cheatsheets](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are so well done that I have put them all into a single [pdf](./materials/pdf/R_Studio_Cheat_Sheets.pdf) and keep it on my Desktop.   \n- [Computing for Data Analysis](), coursera course.     \n- [Data Science Specialization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjSzJtWWw1NXNYSE0/view),  slides from all nine courses.       \n- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjSzJtWWw1NXNYSE0/view),  all slides  from Hastie and Tibshirani videos (James et al., 2013).    \n- [Topics in Computational Data Analysis and Graphics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjbXhGWGtCbTczSFk/view), slide to Ross Ihaka's course.    \n- [Statistical Computing](./materials/pdf/Ihaka and Murrell (2015) Statistical Computing.pdf), quick review of basic R syntax. \n- [Introduction to data analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjdTE3OVhad3kzSE0/view), Hadley Wickham's slides from Rice University.   \n\n\n##Goto places \n- [A GOOD PLACE TO START LEARNING R](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/): RStudio team collects the best online resources. Check out every link they mention, it's worth it.    \n- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - thorough and convenient resource for R reference. One of the first results to show up in search engines.   \n- [R by Example](http://www.mayin.org/ajayshah/KB/R/) organized example scripts.   \n- [Most useful R commands](http://www.personality-project.org/r/r.commands.html) according to [personality-project.org](http://www.personality-project.org/index.html) ([William Revelle](http://www.personality-project.org/revelle.html)).  \n- [areaF](https://github.com/andkov/areaF/blob/master/concept.md) is a visual display of ANOVA table, comparing and contrasting the properties of restricted (basic, null) and full(saturated, alternative) models.  \n\n\n## Videos\n\n###Collections\n- [twotorials](http://www.twotorials.com/) A collection of video tutorials on R\n- [Hastie and Tibshirani](http://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/) narrate their book.   \n\n###Particulars\n- [lady tasting tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgs7d5saFFc) short video on designing experiment in words of R.A. Fisher.    \n- [dude tapping bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVMVGHkt2cg) or p-value extravaganza.   \n\n\n##Data \n\n- Excellent [collection of datasets](http://www.statsci.org/datasets.html).   \n- [HistData](./data/HistData/Encyclopedia_HistData.md) Wiki overviews some of the historic datasets from the [HistData](./data/HistData/README.md) package that will be used in the course.  \n\n\n\n## Views and conventions \n\n- I do my best to follow the [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)\n\n# More \n\n[edit me](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/edit/master/resources.md)  \n \n \n \n \n \n",
