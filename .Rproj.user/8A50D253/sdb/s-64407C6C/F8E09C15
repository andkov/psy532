It is of utmost importance that students who do their work honestly be protected from those who do not.  Because this policy is in place to ensure that students carry out and benefit from the learning activities assigned in each course, it is expected that students will cooperate in its implementation.\n\n*The offences defined by the policy can be summarized briefly as follows*:  \n\n1.  **Plagiarism**. You must make sure that the work you submit is your work and not someone elseâ€™s.  There are proper procedures for citing the works of others.  The student is responsible for being aware of and using these procedures.  \n2.\t**Multiple Submission**.  Only under exceptional circumstances may a work submitted to fulfill an academic requirement be used to satisfy another similar requirement. The student is responsible for clarifying this with the instructor(s) involved.    \n3.\t**Falsifying Materials Subject to Academic Evaluation**.  This includes falsification of data, use of commercially prepared essays, using information from the Internet without proper citation, citing sources from which material is not actually obtained, etc.  \n4.\t**Cheating on Assignments, Tests, and Examinations**.  You may not copy the work of others in or out of class; you may not give your work to others for the purpose of copying; you may not use unauthorized material or equipment during examinations or tests; and you may not impersonate or allow yourself to be impersonated by another at an examination. The Department of Psychology has a policy of not making old examinations available for study purposes.  Therefore, use of old exams without the express written permission of the instructor constitutes cheating by the user, and abetting of cheating by the person who provided the exam.  \n5.\t**Being an Accessory to Offences**.  This means that helping another student to cheat (for instance, by showing or communicating to them answers to an assignment, or by allowing them to view answers on an exam) is an academic offence.  \n",
