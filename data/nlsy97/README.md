##NLSY97

Data acquisition and processing are described in my lecture on [Data Manipulation](http://ialsa.github.io/COAG-colloquium-2014F/2014-10-21-Data-Manipulation.html#1) at the [COAG-colloquium-2014F](https://github.com/IALSA/COAG-colloquium-2014F) repository. Clone the repository to explore the native context of the examples in the lectures. 

`./scripts/data/dsL_nlsy97.r` processes the raw archival data and produces basic analysis and graphs
