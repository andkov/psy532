<!--  The 1st mandatory chunck  -->
<!--  Set the working directory to the repository's base directory -->
```{r, echo=F, message=F} 
#Don't combine this call with any other chunk 
# cat("Working directory: ", getwd()) # check where you are
  library(knitr)
# Rmd is in "./reports/reportA/reportA.Rmd", but now the root is "./"
  knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir='../../') 
```

<!--  The 2nd mandatory chunck  -->
<!-- Set the report-wide options, and point to the external code file. -->
```{r set_options, echo=F}
# connect to the file with the underlying R script  
read_chunk("./reportA/reportA.R") 
# set options shared by all chunks

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
