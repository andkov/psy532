##Programming in R
- [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r)  by DataCamp. Slick, responsive interface. Great place to start for complete newbies to programming in general.      
- [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)  by [Software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) 
- [Introduction to R](http://ateucher.github.io/rcourse_site/)  by [Andy Teucher](https://github.com/ateucher). Great example of github use. Local option.   

##Data Science
- [Swirl courses](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) and my [annotations](./materials/swirl/course_notes.md) to them. [quick start with swirl](./materials/swirl/quickstart.md). Most of the courses overlap with (*DSS*), giving the same material in the interactive environment of RStudio. It also have unique courses, which number is expected to increase in the future.    
- [Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization) and particularly their [Curated Knowledge](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/curated/) page. One of the best resources on data science has been coming from John Hopkins University, as did this lecture series on Coursera.   
- [Introduction to data analysis](http://stat405.had.co.nz/) course Hadley Wickham taught at Rice University in 2012    
- [Information Visualization](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/courses/120/lectures.html) course by Ross Ihaka, one of the creators of R language. Also see his courses on [Statistical Computing](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~stats380/?Lecture_Slides) and  [Statistical Graphics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/courses/787/)
 


##Statistics
- [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-and-statistical-inference_mine-cetinkaya-rundel-by-datacamp) by DataCamp.    
- [Introduction to Biostatistics](http://stronginference.com/Bios6301/)  taught by [Chris Fonnesbeck](https://github.com/fonnesbeck?tab=repositories) at Vanderbilt University.    
- Collection of [R Tutorials](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) by Kelly Black at Clarkson Univeristy. Approximately covers an intro to stats undergrad course.  
- [Statistical Computing for Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/courses/statcomputing/)  by Honkgkai Ji, at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.    
- [Statistical Computing in R](http://www.pitt.edu/~njc23/) a biostatistics course by   Nicholas Christian at University of Pittsburgh.  Great series of slides on essential programming vocabulary and techniques  for statistical modeling. Exemplifies SWEAVE for report generation.  
- [Statistical Inference](http://statpower.net/310LectureSlides.html), introductory course in statistics for graduate students at Vanderbilt University, taught by James Steiger.      


##Blogs 

- [Data School](http://www.dataschool.io/about/) blog and learning space by [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham), former *DSS* TA and developer.    
- [rbloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) central hub for blogging about data science with R.    


##Handy PDFs
- [RStudio cheatsheets](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are so well done that I have put them all into a single [pdf](./materials/pdf/R_Studio_Cheat_Sheets.pdf) and keep it on my Desktop.   
- [Computing for Data Analysis](), coursera course.     
- [Data Science Specialization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjQ0R1QUM0cE4tQm8/view),  slides from all nine courses. Files is too big to view online (130 MB), download first.          
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjSzJtWWw1NXNYSE0/view),  all slides  from Hastie and Tibshirani videos (James et al., 2013).    
- [Topics in Computational Data Analysis and Graphics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjbXhGWGtCbTczSFk/view), slide to Ross Ihaka's course.    
- [Statistical Computing](./materials/pdf/Ihaka and Murrell (2015) Statistical Computing.pdf), quick review of basic R syntax. 
- [Introduction to data analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KlNxv-FHyjdTE3OVhad3kzSE0/view), Hadley Wickham's slides from Rice University.
