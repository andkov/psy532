##Go-to places 
- [A GOOD PLACE TO START LEARNING R](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/): RStudio team collects the best online resources. Check out every link they mention, it's worth it.  
- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - thorough and convenient resource for R reference. One of the first results to show up in search engines. 
- [RStudio cheatsheets](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are so well done that I have put them all into a single [pdf](./materials/pdf/R_Studio_Cheat_Sheets.pdf) and keep it on my Desktop.
- [R by Example](http://www.mayin.org/ajayshah/KB/R/) organized example scripts. 
- [Most useful R commands](http://www.personality-project.org/r/r.commands.html) according to [personality-project.org](http://www.personality-project.org/index.html) ([William Revelle](http://www.personality-project.org/revelle.html))
 - [areaF](https://github.com/andkov/areaF/blob/master/concept.md) is a visual display of ANOVA table, comparing and contrasting the properties of restricted (basic, null) and full(saturated, alternative) models.
