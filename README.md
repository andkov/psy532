### Texts

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (James, Witten Hastie, and Tibshirani, 2013), free online text and lecture slides are available. 

- [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) ( Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill, 2006) : really is about multilevel modelling, but has excellent treatment of basic regression, model diagnostics, and offers rich procedural wisdom of practical modelling. 


- [R Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do) by Winston Chan  is a perfect book to get you started with producing graphs with RStudio




## Overview

  
Elaborating on the graphing templates developed in [DeShea, Toochacher, and Beasley]() we  will look at some famous datasets in the history of statistics (e.g. [HistData]() package) and some real-world collections of social science data (e.g. [ELSA](), [HRS](), [NLSY]()).
  
### Software  

I will be making extensive use of the following packages:
   - dplyr  
   - reshape2  
   - ggplot2  
   - knitr  
   - HistData  
   - stats

### Evaluation and Grading 

...


The final letter grade in the course will be based on total percent score rounded to the third decimal point as shown in the table:    

Grade | Lowest  | Highest | Description
------|--------|---------|------------
A+|90|100|Exceptional Work   Technically flawless and original work demonstrating insight, understanding and independent application or extension of course expectations; often publishable. 
A |85|89 |Outstanding Work   Demonstrates a very high level of integration of material demonstrating insight, understanding and independent application or extension of course expectations. 
A-|80|84 |Excellent Work   Represents a high level of integration, comprehensiveness and complexity, as well as mastery of relevant techniques/concepts.      
B+|77|79 |Very good work   Represents a satisfactory level of integration, comprehensiveness, and complexity; demonstrates a sound level of analysis with no major weaknesses. 
B |73|76 |Acceptable work that fulfills the expectations of the course   Represents a satisfactory level of integration of key concepts/procedures. However, comprehensiveness or technical skills may be lacking. 
B-|70|72 |Unacceptable work
C+|65|69 |Unacceptable work
C |60|64 |Unacceptable work
D |50|59 |Unacceptable work  
F  | 0|49 |Failing grade   Unsatisfactory performance. Wrote final examination and completed course requirements. 



### Commitment to Inclusivity and Diversity

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing and protecting a positive and supportive and safe learning and working environment for all its members.  

### Academic Integrity 

The Department of Psychology fully endorses and intends to enforce rigorously the [Senate Policy on Academic integrity](http://web.uvic.ca/calendar2011/FACS/UnIn/UARe/PoAcI.html)(p. 33-34, UVic Calendar 2014-15).  It is of utmost importance that students who do their work honestly be protected from those who do not.  Because this policy is in place to ensure that students carry out and benefit from the learning activities assigned in each course, it is expected that students will cooperate in its implementation.

*The offences defined by the policy can be summarized briefly as follows*:  

1.  **Plagiarism**. You must make sure that the work you submit is your work and not someone elseâ€™s.  There are proper procedures for citing the works of others.  The student is responsible for being aware of and using these procedures.  
2.	**Multiple Submission**.  Only under exceptional circumstances may a work submitted to fulfill an academic requirement be used to satisfy another similar requirement. The student is responsible for clarifying this with the instructor(s) involved.    
3.	**Falsifying Materials Subject to Academic Evaluation**.  This includes falsification of data, use of commercially prepared essays, using information from the Internet without proper citation, citing sources from which material is not actually obtained, etc.  
4.	**Cheating on Assignments, Tests, and Examinations**.  You may not copy the work of others in or out of class; you may not give your work to others for the purpose of copying; you may not use unauthorized material or equipment during examinations or tests; and you may not impersonate or allow yourself to be impersonated by another at an examination. The Department of Psychology has a policy of not making old examinations available for study purposes.  Therefore, use of old exams without the express written permission of the instructor constitutes cheating by the user, and abetting of cheating by the person who provided the exam.  
5.	**Being an Accessory to Offences**.  This means that helping another student to cheat (for instance, by showing or communicating to them answers to an assignment, or by allowing them to view answers on an exam) is an academic offence.
