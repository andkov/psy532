###Texts

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (James, Witten Hastie, and Tibshirani, 2013), free online text and lecture slides are available. 

- [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) ( Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill, 2006) : really is about multilevel modelling, but has excellent treatment of basic regression, model diagnostics, and offers rich procedural wisdom of practical modelling. 


- [R Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do) by Winston Chan  is a perfect book to get you started with producing graphs with RStudio




##Overview

  
Elaborating on the graphing templates developed in [DeShea, Toochacher, and Beasley]() we  will look at some famous datasets in the history of statistics (e.g. [HistData]() package) and some real-world collections of social science data (e.g. [ELSA](), [HRS](), [NLSY]()).
  
###Software  

I will be making extensive use of the following packages:
   - dplyr  
   - reshape2  
   - ggplot2  
   - knitr  
   - HistData  
   - stats
