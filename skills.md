Reproducible Research requires fou4 sets of skills:  
1. Data Manipulation  
2. Graph Production  
3. Statistical Modeling  
4. Dynamic Reporting  

You can review my discussion of toolbox and skillset of reproducible research in slides and videoes [here](http://ialsa.github.io/COAG-colloquium-2014F/)


#Skill sets
  Links grouped by the skillset.

## Data Management

-  [Introduction to data cleaning in R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf), a discussion paper by Edwin de Jonge and 
Mark van der Loo.

## Graph Production
- Winston Chang's [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) is a perfect book to get you started with producing graphs with RStudio.  
- [ggplots for publication](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/11/20/formatting-plots-for-pubs.html).  






## Statistical Modeling 
   - Doug Bates on statistical modeling with Julia([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9Io-p_iymI)   

### Package support  

#### Package dplyr::
- [Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) the official vignette of the package.  
- [Tutorials for the dplyr package in R](https://github.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial) by [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham)
- A work-along scripts following Wickham's [Tidy data](https://github.com/justmarkham/tidy-data) paper, but re-doing it in dplyr. 


#### Package stats::

##### Function stats::lm()

##### Function stats::glm() 

 - Comparing functions [stats::lm() vs stats::glm()](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/comments/2izyw1/difference_between_glm_and_lm_lmyxz_and_glmyxz/)  
 
#### Package lme4::  
 - lme4::lmer()  

#### Package nlme::

##### Function nlme::gls()  
 -    
 
##### Function nlme::lme()

 - Comparing functions [nlme::gls() vs. nlme::lme()](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395102/gls-vs-lme-in-the-nlme-package)  











## Dynamic reporting

###Git and GitHub
- [GitHub cheat sheet](https://github.com/justmarkham/github-cheat-sheet) by Kevin Markham. All issues have screen-shots. More resources in the README after the link.
- [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) by Kevin Markham



### Markdown
- in-browser [markdown simulator](https://demo.ocpu.io/markdownapp/www/), created in javascript by  [Jeroen Ooms](http://jeroenooms.github.io/). Great for playing with markdown formatting and doing simple tasks and demonstrations in R without installation.

- [markdown in R](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.ca/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html) : a blog entry on getting started with **rmarkdown** - a version of markdown enhanced for the use with RStudio.  By Jeromy Anglim.
- [markdown guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) : a well-written "breaking into" guide. Gives ample verbal description. Recommended for newbies. By John Gruber.  
- [markdown cheat-sheet](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) : brief, simple, parallel view of what the code is doing. By Mashery group.   

- another [markdown simulator](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html) with a different feel. You can't run R script in here, but it's good for understanding the formatting. Give a link to a decent cheatsheet on markdown. 


### Rmarkdown
- see the official [documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) by RStudio, best starting point IMHO

### Slides  
- RStudio provides a native format for creating presentations - **.Rpres**, availible in the "New file" option. For a quick start with .Rpres see this [article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations)
